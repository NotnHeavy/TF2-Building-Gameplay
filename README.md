# Building Gameplay
This is a horrible plugin I wrote for a gamenight in SolarLight's Discord server. As a consequence, the code is incredibly rushed, lazy, and hot garbage. It means the plugin is also incredibly jank, but honestly? It's pretty funny.

Just don't use the code of this plugin as a sample of my traditional work.

Here you can spawn as different buildings rather than the traditional TF2 classes:
- Sentry Gun - 325hp, 200hu/s (+attack3 - toggle Wrangler mode)
- Dispenser - 250hp, 300hu/s (+attack3 - use UberCharge, lasts 12 seconds and heals you and surrounding targets at a rate of 200hp/s)
- Teleporter - 150hp, 250hu/s (+attack3 - spawn an entrance which will teleport teammates and disguised Spy Sentries to you)
- Sapper - 50hp, 450hu/s (only ability is to run into buildings to explode the target)
- Mini Sentry - 100hp, 400hu/s (+attack3 - toggle Wrangler mode)
- Spy Sentry - 125hp, 200hu/s (+attack3 - undisguise (or disguise back) to target players)
